Hovv unreasonable it is to judg of impossibilities, in order to Gods omnipotency, because they seeme so to our human understandings.

    _ RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT.

      * SECT. II. The Protestants evasion of the cleerness of Scripture against our Roman doctrin, as also of the invisibility of their own Church, confuted: and the incredibility of the supposed change and Apostasy, proved by the difference of the Roman Catholick, and Protestant principles.

      * SECT. VIII. Protestants mistaken in the consistency of their justifying faith with justice, or civil Government. Demonstrated in the new setlement of Irland, and in the persecution against Catholicks in England: and yet the King and his government vindicated from the note of Tyrany, or the breach of publick faith; because his Ministers are compell'd, by a necessity of state, to run with the spirit and principles of Protestancy: Notwithstanding all which the Irish, and English Roman Catholicks are bound in conscience not to attempt the recovery of their right or Religion by arms, but rather to submit them-selves to his Majesty, and suffer their crosses with Christian patience.

How every Protestant is a Pope; and how much also they are overseen in making the 39. Articles or the oath of Supremacy a distinctive sign of Loyalty to our Protestant Kings.

      * SECT. X. How the fundamental principles of the Protestant Reformations maturely examined, and strictly followed, have led the most learned Protestants of the world, to Iudaisme, Atheisme, Arianisme, Mahometanisme &c. and their best modern wits and writers to admit of no other Rule of Religion but Natural Reason; and the Protestants Churches of Poland, Hungary, and Transilvania, to deny the Mystery of the Trinity.

      * SECT. XI. How the indifferency, or rather inclination, of Protestancy to all kind of infidelity, is further demonstrated by the Prelatick doctrin, and distinction of fundamental and not fundamental articles of faith.
